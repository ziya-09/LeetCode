Q) You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500


Soln : class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        // Sort the array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(salary);

        double sum = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of all salaries between the minimum and maximum salaries
        // We start at index 1 and end at index length - 2, since we're excluding the minimum and maximum salaries
        for(int i = 1; i < salary.length - 1; i++){
            sum += salary[i];
        }

        // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of salaries used in the calculation
        return sum / (salary.length - 2.0);
    }
}
